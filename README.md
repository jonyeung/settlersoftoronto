## Team Members:

## Description
A multiplayer (3-4 players) online board game similar to the Settles of Catan but with our own custom rules. 

## Key Features by Beta
Action Cards made, Resource Cards made, game board made, Game mechanics implemented, multiplayer online enabled.

## Additional Features for Final Version
Game lobby front end made, Database implemented to store game state, keeping track of stats for each player (ie. wins, losses etc.) Game animations.

## Technologies
Firebase Database, ReactJS, BoardGame.io, react-game-kit.

## Top 5 Technical Challenges
1. Creating turn based actions and preventing others from interfering
2. Saving a game state so that others can rejoin when they disconnect
3. Connecting players to the same game and having their actions/moves on the board be synced across all players
4. Creating private game "rooms" specific to the players in that lobby
5. Creating the game board
